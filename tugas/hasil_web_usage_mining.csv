10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_6,‘Internet of Things’ and ‘Social Networking’: Containment,"Moving to the post-2000 period, or the post-formation Internet Polity, this chapter begins with the implications of the internet becoming the centred repository of sources, medium of investigation, and object in historicist accounts of recent and contemporary events. Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’). This chapter, and the study, concludes by briefly reconsidering the formative first principles of the Internet Polity, and pinpointing areas for further investigations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_6

This paper explores the prevalence of power-law distributions in large-scale graph structures and their implications for graph query analysis. We investigate techniques for efficiently mining graphs that exhibit power-law characteristics, leveraging these distributions to optimize query performance and scalability. Our study presents a comprehensive review of existing methodologies for detecting power-law behavior in graphs, highlighting their impact on graph traversal, indexing, and query execution. We also examine algorithmic optimizations tailored for power-law graphs, including degree-based indexing, community-aware search techniques, and efficient subgraph matching approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of power-law principles in diverse domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how power-law-aware techniques improve query efficiency and reduce computational complexity in large graph databases. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the interplay between graph topology and query optimization, paving the way for enhanced graph mining frameworks. Our work contributes to the development of more scalable and intelligent graph query processing systems, with broad implications for data-driven decision-making.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-93802-3_7

10.1007/978-3-031-93257-1_6,Adaptive Web API Recommendation via Matching Service Clusters and Mashup Requirement,"With the rapid proliferation of Web services and Web APIs, recommendation systems can effectively address the issue of information overload and alleviate the burden of meaningless filtering. Existing approaches can help filtering appropriate Web services for mashup creation, however, they often fall short of developers’ different and personalized needs by recommending only a fixed number of APIs and lack precision in aligning mashup requirements across all categories. To solve the above issue, this paper introduces a novel Web service recommendation framework called AWAR for mashup creation, which focuses on the matching strategy between mashup requirements and Web APIs, and enhances recommendation effectiveness by integrating natural language processing, optimization algorithms, and deep learning. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach receives superior recommendation results on multiple evaluation metrics compared to advanced competing baselines.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-93257-1_6
10.1007/978-3-032-02088-8_29,Benchmarking Embedding Techniques for Modeling User Navigation Behavior on Task-Oriented Software,"Understanding user navigation patterns from clickstream data is crucial for improving business software, yet remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of real-world environments. Unlike controlled settings, real-world clickstreams are noisy, fragmented, and often incomplete, due to session timeouts, network issues, caching, or third-party interactions—making it difficult to reconstruct coherent user journeys. Additionally, the absence of labeled data hinders the use of supervised learning, pushing researchers toward unsupervised or heuristic-based approaches that struggle to fully capture user behavior. In this paper, we present a benchmark of embedding techniques for modeling user navigation behavior on task-oriented software. We identify distinct user behaviors across three real-world case studies. Results show that Pattern2Vec outperforms Word2Vec in capturing meaningful task-based navigation patterns, confirming its suitability for clickstream analysis.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02088-8_29
10.1007/978-3-032-01723-9_9,Analyzing Water Consumption Patterns in Mexico City: A GIS and Data Science Approach,"Water scarcity in Mexico City has become an increasingly urgent issue, exacerbated by inefficient and unequal consumption patterns across its urban fabric. This study advances Geographic Information Systems (GIS) research by developing and applying an integrative spatial analysis framework specifically tailored to the complexities of urban water management. Beyond its application to Mexico City, the research demonstrates how GIS can be used to fuse heterogeneous datasets, including those from SACMEX (Mexico City’s Water System), INEGI (National Institute of Statistics and Geography), and DENUE (National Directory of Economic Units), into a unified analytical environment. Through a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), spatial data mining, and clustering techniques, the study identifies critical disparities in water consumption at multiple spatial scales, from boroughs to neighborhoods. A key contribution is the implementation of a layered system architecture for managing historic spatiotemporal data, enabling dynamic visualization of consumption patterns. The findings reveal that socio-economic and demographic variables play a decisive role in shaping spatial water demand, with marginalized communities facing disproportionate challenges. While previous spatiotemporal analyses of water consumption in Mexico City have primarily focused on aggregated borough-level data or isolated socio-demographic correlations, they have often lacked multiscale integration, high-resolution neighborhood-level analysis, or interactive visualization tools to support policy development. This research addresses these limitations by providing a fine-grained, multilayered analytical approach that enhances the scientific understanding of urban water use. Beyond offering immediate policy-relevant insights for Mexico City, the methodological framework proposed here contributes to GIS research by providing a scalable, transferable approach for analyzing urban resource consumption patterns. Future work will focus on incorporating real-time data streams, expanding sector-specific analysis, and integrating additional variables and domains required for a comprehensive understanding of water dynamics. This study represents a first step toward building an adaptive, equitable, and efficient urban water management strategy.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-01723-9_9
10.1007/978-981-96-6951-6_19,Research on Sensor Behavioral Psychological Health Based on Multi-task Learning,"As society develops, mental health is becoming increasingly important. Traditional mental health assessment methods, such as face-to-face interviews and observational techniques, are limited by several factors, including subjectivity, response delays, and high costs. To address these issues, recent research has utilized smart sensor data. Using smartphones to collect data provides valuable insights into student behavior while ensuring the privacy of the individuals involved. The transition from traditional questionnaires to sensor data has prompted the adoption of a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for a more comprehensive classification of mental health. This study investigates the relationship between behavioral attributes and mental health dimensions, using the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining and feature extraction. This method uncovers significant correlations, highlighting the close connection between mental health and behavioral data through detailed analysis. The study proposes the use of multi-task modeling to optimize information utilization and identify correlations across tasks. The introduction of the Deep Cross Network with Squeeze and Excitation Network and Progressive Layered Extraction (DC-SE-PLE), a deep learning neural network model, enhances hierarchical feature extraction and cross-task learning, significantly improving the model’s generalization and prediction accuracy.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-96-6951-6_19
10.1007/978-3-031-89518-0_1,On the Centrality of Web Trackers: Assessing Its Potential for Automated Detection,"For the past 20 years, web tracking has raised worries among privacy advocates and authorities responsible for data protection. Researchers have proposed several machine learning-driven remedies to identify Web trackers in an automated manner. While those have displayed potential, they have primarily remained as proofs-of-concept. This work extends on t.ex-Graph outlined in our previous work [ 36 ]. The aim of this model is to distinguish benign from tracking hosts by considering their centrality in the network, and data flows to them. Based on the results of our previous work, we abandoned the SLD-based approach. Consequently, we made slight modifications to the feature vector. Our classifier’s performance is comparable to its original version, and we tested its cross-browser and longitudinal performance. Our results indicate that while the cross-browser performance significantly decreases, the longitudinal performance maintains a high level.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-89518-0_1
10.1007/978-3-032-02215-8_6,FNoDe: Faulty Node Detection in Microservices Architecture,"As cloud services shift from monolithic architectures to microservices, post-failure fault and anomaly detection becomes increasingly challenging due to cascading effects across interdependent services and the overwhelming volume of heterogeneous logs and metrics. We propose FNoDe (Faulty Node Detection), a framework that integrates application logs, performance metrics, and distributed traces into a unified graph structure to detect both the root cause and type of anomaly. By leveraging a graph convolutional network (GCN), FNoDe learns system representations under normal and anomalous states from historical microservice data and uses these embeddings to classify new system states. Evaluated on five public benchmarks and two in-house microservice systems, FNoDe outperforms traditional methods by 20–30% in accuracy and maintains competitive performance with state-of-the-art frameworks, while also offering interpretability through XAI techniques.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02215-8_6
10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_5,The Vocabulary and Culture of Internet Collectivity,"Taking a wider view, but still with a predominant focus on the 1990s, this chapter describes how a distinctive vocabulary for Internet Polity discourse developed and how cultural significance was attributed to collective activities on the internet. A brief discussion of the nodal term—‘internet’, and coterminously words with ‘e-’ and ‘digital’ prefixes—precedes that. An account of computing and internet dictionaries (and glossaries and word-listings) fleshes out the vocabulary that was consolidated as Internet Polity discourse. Several phases of dictionary making are covered: of computing terms for professionals, of computing terms for lay users, of hacker slang/jargon/techspeak, of internet terms in themselves, of internet slang Slang and cyberlexicography. Turning next to attributions of cultural collectivity via Internet Technology, the overlaps and distinction between Technoculture ‘technoculture’, ‘cyberculture Cyberculture ’, and ‘digital culture Digital culture ’ are unpacked. After pausing on the rise of popular ‘online communities’, a final section delineates the normative and ideological shifts that took place around the term ‘hacker’.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_5
10.1007/978-3-032-02049-9_20,DInos: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to Generalizable Autoscaling in Stateless Cloud Applications,"Efficient autoscaling in Kubernetes (K8s)-managed in-memory systems like Redis remains a critical challenge, especially under highly dynamic workloads. Traditional threshold-based mechanisms (e.g., HPA) often fail to anticipate sudden demand surges, leading to poor performance and inefficient resource use. We introduce DInos , a Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) agent enhanced with LSTM layers and transfer learning, designed for proactive and adaptive autoscaling in Kubernetes. As an evolution of our earlier agent DERP, DInos leverages temporal workload modeling and pre-trained policies to generalize across deployments with minimal retraining. DInos utilizes a customizable reward function balancing throughput, latency, resource usage, and pod efficiency. DInos achieves up to 17.3 $$\times $$ × higher rewards in simulation and a 5.5 $$\times $$ × improvement in real-world K8s-Redis deployments by forecasting spikes, optimizing pod counts and maintaining low latency, providing a robust autoscaling solution for volatile, cloud-native environments.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02049-9_20

Malicious URLs serve as gateways for various cyber-attacks, including malware distribution, phishing attempts, defacement activities, and spam propagation. Detecting these malicious URLs requires advanced techniques that can analyze and distinguish between benign and harmful web entities. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools in this endeavor, leveraging diverse feature categories and sophisticated classifiers to differentiate between legitimate and harmful URLs. In our study, we evaluated the performance of ML algorithms, with Random Forest achieving notable accuracy rates of 96.83% for binary classification and 92.13% for multi-classification, outperforming other classifiers. Our investigation spans Lexical, Content Analysis, Identity Verification, Identity Similarity, Visual Similarity, Behavioral Analysis, Entropy Analysis, and Geographic Analysis features. Our research seeks to provide comprehensive insights into the methodologies and approaches employed in malicious URL detection. This research adopts a systematic, manual process to identify and rank critical URL characteristics, ensuring relevance and interpretability.

For large-scale data archiving, highly efficient data compression techniques are vital for minimizing storage overhead, communication efficiency, and optimizing data retrieval performance. This paper presents a scalable parallel workflow designed to compress vast collections of files on high-performance computing systems. Leveraging the Permute-Partition-Compress (PPC) paradigm, the proposed workflow optimizes both compression ratio and processing speed. By integrating a data clustering technique, our solution effectively addresses the challenges posed by large-scale data collections in terms of compression efficiency and scalability. Experiments were conducted on the Leonardo petascale supercomputer of CINECA (leonardo-supercomputer.cineca.eu), and processed a subset of the Software Heritage archive, consisting of about 49 million files of C++ code, totaling 1.1 TB of space.

This is particularly challenging for resource-constrained languages like Bengali. This paper presents a dataset specifically created for detecting contextual hate speech in Bengali, developed through extensive data collection, preprocessing, and both manual and automatic labeling. It comprises 15,000 annotated texts categorized into hate speech and non-hate speech, with a Cohen’s kappa score of 0.88, reflecting strong agreement among annotators. We assessed the dataset using machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and BERT-based models. Among these, the BERT-based model XLM-R excelled, attaining an F1 score of 0.94 and an accuracy of 0.92 when context was considered, and an F1 score of 0.89 with an accuracy of 0.87 without context. These findings highlight that integrating context notably enhances the accuracy of hate speech detection, contributing to more effective methods for identifying and mitigating harmful online content.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-85240-4_24
10.1007/978-3-031-97141-9_20,ViMRHP: A Vietnamese Benchmark Dataset for Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction via Human-AI Collaborative Annotation,"Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction (MRHP) is an essential task in recommender systems, particularly in E-commerce platforms. Determining the helpfulness of user-generated reviews enhances user experience and improves consumer decision-making. However, existing datasets focus predominantly on English and Indonesian, resulting in a lack of linguistic diversity, especially for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. In this paper, we introduce ViMRHP ( Vi etnamese M ultimodal R eview H elpfulness P rediction), a large-scale benchmark dataset for MRHP task in Vietnamese. This dataset covers four domains, including 2K products with 46K reviews. Meanwhile, a large-scale dataset requires considerable time and cost. To optimize the annotation process, we leverage AI to assist annotators in constructing the ViMRHP dataset. With AI assistance, annotation time is reduced (90–120 seconds/task $$\rightarrow $$ → 20–40 seconds/task) while maintaining data quality and lowering overall costs by approximately 65%. However, AI-generated annotations still have limitations in complex annotation tasks, which we further examine through a detailed performance analysis. In our experiment on ViMRHP, we evaluate baseline models on human-verified and AI-generated annotations to assess their quality differences. The ViMRHP dataset is publicly available at ( https://github.com/trng28/ViMRHP ).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-97141-9_20

The architectures can be categorized as supporting: (1) virtual integration (federated and mediated), (2) physical integration (data warehouse), and (3) hybrid (data lake, data lakehouse, data mesh). Regardless of their specific type, all these architectures rely on a complex integration layer. The layer is implemented by a sophisticated software, for designing, orchestrating, and running the so-called DI processes. On the one hand, in all business domains, large volumes of highly heterogeneous data are produced, e.g., medical systems, smart cities, smart agriculture, which require further advancements in the data integration technologies. On the other hand, the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions is now extending towards DI, offering alternative solutions, opening new research paths, and generating new open problems. In this talk, I will share my perspective on the application and potential of AI solutions for selected DI problems. I will also highlight still unresolved issues within the field of DI. The talk will be structured into three main parts: (1) an overview of data integration architectures, (2) selected AI techniques for DI (like data wrangling, data quality, schema matching, optimization of systems, and code generation), and (3) still open problems in DI.

A specific aspect of food waste concerns meat consumption in gastronomy, where typically only prime cuts of meat are used in the kitchen. To facilitate the usage of all parts of animals and thereby reducing food waste, we present Onfoods , a system that recommends alternative meat cuts in recipes and integrates inventory data to help with the creation of menus. Onfoods uses an ontology and a knowledge graph to model recipes, meat cuts and the relationships between the two, similarity measures to find candidates for alternative meat cuts, and inventory data to track the availability of different meat cuts. An intuitive user interface allows the user on one hand to update the knowledge graph and inventory data, and on the other hand to navigate through recipes and choose alternative meat cuts.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02088-8_5
10.1007/978-3-032-02088-8_8,Efficient Source Selection for Federated SPARQL Queries Using Adjacent Predicate Information,"With the growing adoption of Linked Open Data (LOD), many distributed knowledge bases have been developed using the RDF format. These knowledge bases each have unique characteristics, and querying across them can reveal richer and more comprehensive insights. To support such cross-repository querying, federated RDF query processing is essential. However, the performance of federated query execution largely depends on efficient source selection—the process of identifying which data sources are relevant to a given query. In this paper, we propose a novel source selection method for federated RDF queries based on a new summarization technique. Our approach precomputes the existence of shared elements between predicate pairs within each data source, considering three types of join patterns: subject–subject, subject–object, and object–object. These relationships are stored in a matrix-form summary for each data source. During query execution, our method identifies predicate pairs from triple patterns that share join keys within a basic graph pattern (BGP) and uses the precomputed summaries to efficiently determine the relevant data sources. Experimental results on the FedBench benchmark show that our method improves the efficiency of source selection and significantly reduces overall query execution time.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02088-8_8
