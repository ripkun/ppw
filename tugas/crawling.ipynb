      "Abstract: Context: Systems of Systems (SoS) constitute a type of complex software systems resulting from integrating heterogeneous constituent systems that are independently operable on their own but are networked together for a common goal. Each constituent system has its own purpose and could operate and collaborate voluntarily with other constituent systems to achieve a common goal that cannot be treated by any of them in isolation. Objective: A constituent system may be deployed or undeployed at run-time within an SoS. Emergent behaviors may be undesirable and affect the behaviors of each constituent system and lead to unexpected operations and a lack of permanent status in the SoS. Thus, we need to continuously extract and represent the actual behaviors within the SoS at run-time. Method: In this paper, we implement the first step our “Architecture Mining” approach. Thus, we monitor an SoS and develop Discovery algorithm to extract the actual behaviors. The actual behaviors are presented by a “Discovered Model” dynamically and automatically built from the execution traces. Results: To implement our approach, we applied it to a case study entitled Smart City, which is an SoS including six types of constituent systems. We extracted the actual behaviors executed at run time from the SoS execution traces, which have never been modeled in any constituent system nor expected by the designer.\n",

      "Abstract: Machine learning methods play an important role in creating algorithms for data analysis in the mining industry. These methods allow you to train the system based on historical data and identify hidden patterns that may not be obvious in traditional analysis. Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict breakdowns, optimize production processes and identify anomalies in the operation of machinery. For example, with the help of training on data on the operation of equipment, you can create a model that will predict the probability of failure of a certain part under specified operating conditions.\n",

      "Abstract: Web traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing network resources, enhancing user experience, and ensuring efficient server load management. Traditional approaches, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and machine learning methods like support vector machines and decision trees, focus primarily on temporal data. These models, however, often fail to capture the intricate relationships within web traffic data, such as user interactions or page-to-page connections, resulting in sub-optimal predictive performance. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) address these limitations by modeling web traffic as a graph, where web pages or users are represented as nodes, and their interactions form edges. GCNs aggregate node information through graph structures, enabling the model to learn both spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in web traffic. This ability to exploit complex data relationships makes GCNs well-suited for more accurate and dynamic web traffic predictions. In this work, we propose a GCN-based framework for web traffic forecasting, incorporating multiple optimizers like Adam, RMSProp, and SGD to identify the model’s fair performance. By optimizing training through these methods, the GCN model efficiently captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in web traffic patterns. Our study highlights the potential of GCNs in elevating the accuracy and reliability of web traffic forecasting. The integration of advanced optimizers further enhances convergence and prediction efficiency, offering a more scalable solution to meet the demands of rapidly growing and complex web systems.\n",

      "Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Web services and Web APIs, recommendation systems can effectively address the issue of information overload and alleviate the burden of meaningless filtering. Existing approaches can help filtering appropriate Web services for mashup creation, however, they often fall short of developers’ different and personalized needs by recommending only a fixed number of APIs and lack precision in aligning mashup requirements across all categories. To solve the above issue, this paper introduces a novel Web service recommendation framework called AWAR for mashup creation, which focuses on the matching strategy between mashup requirements and Web APIs, and enhances recommendation effectiveness by integrating natural language processing, optimization algorithms, and deep learning. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach receives superior recommendation results on multiple evaluation metrics compared to advanced competing baselines.\n",

      "Abstract: This paper is associated with a tutorial presented at DEXA 2025 Conferences and Workshops. The tutorial shares the practical experience gained from a 3-year R&D project for a big financial institution in Poland. The project aimed at developing deduplication pipelines for customer records. It involved the development of two distinct end-to-end deduplication pipelines that are based on (1) statistical/probabilistic modeling and on (2) machine learning. This tutorial focuses on lessons learned from developing the machine learning pipeline , within the context of a real-world industrial setting. Moreover, this tutorial provides an overview of approaches to data deduplication, including the traditional state-of-the-art baseline deduplication pipeline, solutions based on machine learning and neural networks that apply pre-trained and large language models.\n",

      "Abstract: This paper is devoted to optimizing the processes of work using intellectual control systems for the transportation and grinding of ore in gold mining fields. Ore is being optimized through the introduction of modern technologies and information systems in the transportation and grinding processes in order to increase efficiency, reduce energy consumption and reduce production costs. The paper examines the applications of IoT technologies, artificial intelligence, and large-scale data analysis in ore transport and grinding processes. With these systems, there is talk of monitoring processes in real time and improving the efficiency of equipment operation. New methods for managing ore transport and grinding processes through mathematical models, optimization algorithms and artificial neural networks are also presented. The results of scientific research in this paper can contribute to innovations and technological developments in the field of gold mining. Improving efficiency through automation of gold mining processes and intellectual management systems not only contributes to economic benefits, but also to the protection of the environment.\n",

      "Abstract: Understanding user navigation patterns from clickstream data is crucial for improving business software, yet remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of real-world environments. Unlike controlled settings, real-world clickstreams are noisy, fragmented, and often incomplete, due to session timeouts, network issues, caching, or third-party interactions—making it difficult to reconstruct coherent user journeys. Additionally, the absence of labeled data hinders the use of supervised learning, pushing researchers toward unsupervised or heuristic-based approaches that struggle to fully capture user behavior. In this paper, we present a benchmark of embedding techniques for modeling user navigation behavior on task-oriented software. We identify distinct user behaviors across three real-world case studies. Results show that Pattern2Vec outperforms Word2Vec in capturing meaningful task-based navigation patterns, confirming its suitability for clickstream analysis.\n",

      "Abstract: Finding frequent itemsets remains challenging due to manual threshold specification requirements in existing algorithms. This paper presents an Enhanced FP-Growth algorithm incorporating a hybrid adaptive support threshold that combines statistical variance analysis, frequency distribution patterns, and transaction density metrics. The algorithm automatically adjusts support levels based on dataset characteristics, eliminating manual threshold tuning. Experimental evaluation on five benchmark datasets against Aprior, FP-growth, and FP-Max shows our Enhanced FP-Growth consistently achieves superior execution time and improved memory efficiency. The hybrid threshold mechanism dynamically calibrates according to dataset characteristics, offering substantial efficiency gains across diverse data types.\n",

      "Title: Adaptive Web API Recommendation via Matching Service Clusters and Mashup Requirement\n",
      "Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Web services and Web APIs, recommendation systems can effectively address the issue of information overload and alleviate the burden of meaningless filtering. Existing approaches can help filtering appropriate Web services for mashup creation, however, they often fall short of developers’ different and personalized needs by recommending only a fixed number of APIs and lack precision in aligning mashup requirements across all categories. To solve the above issue, this paper introduces a novel Web service recommendation framework called AWAR for mashup creation, which focuses on the matching strategy between mashup requirements and Web APIs, and enhances recommendation effectiveness by integrating natural language processing, optimization algorithms, and deep learning. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach receives superior recommendation results on multiple evaluation metrics compared to advanced competing baselines.\n",

      "Abstract: Understanding user navigation patterns from clickstream data is crucial for improving business software, yet remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of real-world environments. Unlike controlled settings, real-world clickstreams are noisy, fragmented, and often incomplete, due to session timeouts, network issues, caching, or third-party interactions—making it difficult to reconstruct coherent user journeys. Additionally, the absence of labeled data hinders the use of supervised learning, pushing researchers toward unsupervised or heuristic-based approaches that struggle to fully capture user behavior. In this paper, we present a benchmark of embedding techniques for modeling user navigation behavior on task-oriented software. We identify distinct user behaviors across three real-world case studies. Results show that Pattern2Vec outperforms Word2Vec in capturing meaningful task-based navigation patterns, confirming its suitability for clickstream analysis.\n",

      "Title: Analyzing Water Consumption Patterns in Mexico City: A GIS and Data Science Approach\n",
      "Abstract: Water scarcity in Mexico City has become an increasingly urgent issue, exacerbated by inefficient and unequal consumption patterns across its urban fabric. This study advances Geographic Information Systems (GIS) research by developing and applying an integrative spatial analysis framework specifically tailored to the complexities of urban water management. Beyond its application to Mexico City, the research demonstrates how GIS can be used to fuse heterogeneous datasets, including those from SACMEX (Mexico City’s Water System), INEGI (National Institute of Statistics and Geography), and DENUE (National Directory of Economic Units), into a unified analytical environment. Through a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), spatial data mining, and clustering techniques, the study identifies critical disparities in water consumption at multiple spatial scales, from boroughs to neighborhoods. A key contribution is the implementation of a layered system architecture for managing historic spatiotemporal data, enabling dynamic visualization of consumption patterns. The findings reveal that socio-economic and demographic variables play a decisive role in shaping spatial water demand, with marginalized communities facing disproportionate challenges. While previous spatiotemporal analyses of water consumption in Mexico City have primarily focused on aggregated borough-level data or isolated socio-demographic correlations, they have often lacked multiscale integration, high-resolution neighborhood-level analysis, or interactive visualization tools to support policy development. This research addresses these limitations by providing a fine-grained, multilayered analytical approach that enhances the scientific understanding of urban water use. Beyond offering immediate policy-relevant insights for Mexico City, the methodological framework proposed here contributes to GIS research by providing a scalable, transferable approach for analyzing urban resource consumption patterns. Future work will focus on incorporating real-time data streams, expanding sector-specific analysis, and integrating additional variables and domains required for a comprehensive understanding of water dynamics. This study represents a first step toward building an adaptive, equitable, and efficient urban water management strategy.\n",

      "Title: Research on Sensor Behavioral Psychological Health Based on Multi-task Learning\n",
      "Abstract: As society develops, mental health is becoming increasingly important. Traditional mental health assessment methods, such as face-to-face interviews and observational techniques, are limited by several factors, including subjectivity, response delays, and high costs. To address these issues, recent research has utilized smart sensor data. Using smartphones to collect data provides valuable insights into student behavior while ensuring the privacy of the individuals involved. The transition from traditional questionnaires to sensor data has prompted the adoption of a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for a more comprehensive classification of mental health. This study investigates the relationship between behavioral attributes and mental health dimensions, using the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining and feature extraction. This method uncovers significant correlations, highlighting the close connection between mental health and behavioral data through detailed analysis. The study proposes the use of multi-task modeling to optimize information utilization and identify correlations across tasks. The introduction of the Deep Cross Network with Squeeze and Excitation Network and Progressive Layered Extraction (DC-SE-PLE), a deep learning neural network model, enhances hierarchical feature extraction and cross-task learning, significantly improving the model’s generalization and prediction accuracy.\n",

      "Abstract: For the past 20 years, web tracking has raised worries among privacy advocates and authorities responsible for data protection. Researchers have proposed several machine learning-driven remedies to identify Web trackers in an automated manner. While those have displayed potential, they have primarily remained as proofs-of-concept. This work extends on t.ex-Graph outlined in our previous work [ 36 ]. The aim of this model is to distinguish benign from tracking hosts by considering their centrality in the network, and data flows to them. Based on the results of our previous work, we abandoned the SLD-based approach. Consequently, we made slight modifications to the feature vector. Our classifier’s performance is comparable to its original version, and we tested its cross-browser and longitudinal performance. Our results indicate that while the cross-browser performance significantly decreases, the longitudinal performance maintains a high level.\n",

      "Abstract: As cloud services shift from monolithic architectures to microservices, post-failure fault and anomaly detection becomes increasingly challenging due to cascading effects across interdependent services and the overwhelming volume of heterogeneous logs and metrics. We propose FNoDe (Faulty Node Detection), a framework that integrates application logs, performance metrics, and distributed traces into a unified graph structure to detect both the root cause and type of anomaly. By leveraging a graph convolutional network (GCN), FNoDe learns system representations under normal and anomalous states from historical microservice data and uses these embeddings to classify new system states. Evaluated on five public benchmarks and two in-house microservice systems, FNoDe outperforms traditional methods by 20–30% in accuracy and maintains competitive performance with state-of-the-art frameworks, while also offering interpretability through XAI techniques.\n",
