This paper explores the prevalence of power-law distributions in large-scale graph structures and their implications for graph query analysis. We investigate techniques for efficiently mining graphs that exhibit power-law characteristics, leveraging these distributions to optimize query performance and scalability. Our study presents a comprehensive review of existing methodologies for detecting power-law behavior in graphs, highlighting their impact on graph traversal, indexing, and query execution. We also examine algorithmic optimizations tailored for power-law graphs, including degree-based indexing, community-aware search techniques, and efficient subgraph matching approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of power-law principles in diverse domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how power-law-aware techniques improve query efficiency and reduce computational complexity in large graph databases. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the interplay between graph topology and query optimization, paving the way for enhanced graph mining frameworks.

10.1007/978-981-96-7238-7_2,Architecture Mining Approach for Systems-of-Systems: Monitoring and Discovery,"Context: Systems of Systems (SoS) constitute a type of complex software systems resulting from integrating heterogeneous constituent systems that are independently operable on their own but are networked together for a common goal. Each constituent system has its own purpose and could operate and collaborate voluntarily with other constituent systems to achieve a common goal that cannot be treated by any of them in isolation. Objective: A constituent system may be deployed or undeployed at run-time within an SoS. Emergent behaviors may be undesirable and affect the behaviors of each constituent system and lead to unexpected operations and a lack of permanent status in the SoS. Thus, we need to continuously extract and represent the actual behaviors within the SoS at run-time. Method: In this paper, we implement the first step our “Architecture Mining” approach. Thus, we monitor an SoS and develop Discovery algorithm to extract the actual behaviors. The actual behaviors are presented by a “Discovered Model” dynamically and automatically built from the execution traces. Results: To implement our approach, we applied it to a case study entitled Smart City, which is an SoS including six types of constituent systems. We extracted the actual behaviors executed at run time from the SoS execution traces, which have never been modeled in any constituent system nor expected by the designer.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-96-7238-7_2

10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_6,‘Internet of Things’ and ‘Social Networking’: Containment,"Moving to the post-2000 period, or the post-formation Internet Polity, this chapter begins with the implications of the internet becoming the centred repository of sources, medium of investigation, and object in historicist accounts of recent and contemporary events. Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’). This chapter, and the study, concludes by briefly reconsidering the formative first principles of the Internet Polity, and pinpointing areas for further investigations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_6
10.1007/978-3-031-93802-3_10,Integrating Graph Convolutional Networks for Web Traffic Prediction,"Web traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing network resources, enhancing user experience, and ensuring efficient server load management. Traditional approaches, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and machine learning methods like support vector machines and decision trees, focus primarily on temporal data. These models, however, often fail to capture the intricate relationships within web traffic data, such as user interactions or page-to-page connections, resulting in sub-optimal predictive performance. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) address these limitations by modeling web traffic as a graph, where web pages or users are represented as nodes, and their interactions form edges. GCNs aggregate node information through graph structures, enabling the model to learn both spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in web traffic. This ability to exploit complex data relationships makes GCNs well-suited for more accurate and dynamic web traffic predictions. In this work, we propose a GCN-based framework for web traffic forecasting, incorporating multiple optimizers like Adam, RMSProp, and SGD to identify the model’s fair performance. By optimizing training through these methods, the GCN model efficiently captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in web traffic patterns. Our study highlights the potential of GCNs in elevating the accuracy and reliability of web traffic forecasting. The integration of advanced optimizers further enhances convergence and prediction efficiency, offering a more scalable solution to meet the demands of rapidly growing and complex web systems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-93802-3_10
10.1007/978-3-031-93257-1_6,Adaptive Web API Recommendation via Matching Service Clusters and Mashup Requirement,"With the rapid proliferation of Web services and Web APIs, recommendation systems can effectively address the issue of information overload and alleviate the burden of meaningless filtering. Existing approaches can help filtering appropriate Web services for mashup creation, however, they often fall short of developers’ different and personalized needs by recommending only a fixed number of APIs and lack precision in aligning mashup requirements across all categories. To solve the above issue, this paper introduces a novel Web service recommendation framework called AWAR for mashup creation, which focuses on the matching strategy between mashup requirements and Web APIs, and enhances recommendation effectiveness by integrating natural language processing, optimization algorithms, and deep learning. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach receives superior recommendation results on multiple evaluation metrics compared to advanced competing baselines.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-93257-1_6

10.1007/978-3-032-02088-8_29,Benchmarking Embedding Techniques for Modeling User Navigation Behavior on Task-Oriented Software,"Understanding user navigation patterns from clickstream data is crucial for improving business software, yet remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of real-world environments. Unlike controlled settings, real-world clickstreams are noisy, fragmented, and often incomplete, due to session timeouts, network issues, caching, or third-party interactions—making it difficult to reconstruct coherent user journeys. Additionally, the absence of labeled data hinders the use of supervised learning, pushing researchers toward unsupervised or heuristic-based approaches that struggle to fully capture user behavior. In this paper, we present a benchmark of embedding techniques for modeling user navigation behavior on task-oriented software. We identify distinct user behaviors across three real-world case studies. Results show that Pattern2Vec outperforms Word2Vec in capturing meaningful task-based navigation patterns, confirming its suitability for clickstream analysis.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02088-8_29

Researchers have proposed several machine learning-driven remedies to identify Web trackers in an automated manner. While those have displayed potential, they have primarily remained as proofs-of-concept. This work extends on t.ex-Graph outlined in our previous work [ 36 ]. The aim of this model is to distinguish benign from tracking hosts by considering their centrality in the network, and data flows to them. Based on the results of our previous work, we abandoned the SLD-based approach. Consequently, we made slight modifications to the feature vector.

10.1007/978-981-96-2771-4_1,Research on Vulnerability Mining Technology of Electric Power Industrial Control Equipment Based on Genetic Algorithm,"The traditional vulnerability mining methods for information systems require prior knowledge of protocol specifications, which often necessitates developers to invest significant time in learning and comprehending the protocol format for effective development of vulnerability mining test cases. However, in the power industry, industrial control equipment utilizes a multitude of private protocols with undisclosed specifications (unknown protocols). Consequently, the conventional vulnerability mining technology based on prior knowledge cannot be directly applied to these unknown industrial control protocols. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method and system of fuzzy testing for industrial control equipment based on genetic algorithms. The objective is to resolve challenges such as prolonged development periods, inability to test unknown protocols, and low efficiency in conducting vulnerability mining tests on unknown protocol vulnerabilities within industrial control equipment.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-96-2771-4_1
10.1007/978-3-032-00350-8_12,Ethical Implications of Using AI to Monitor and Regulate Dark Web Activities,"The dark web continues to attract more illegal activities, and law enforcement and societal security face significant challenges. AI, though strong for monitoring and regulation, does raise critical ethical concerns concerning the use of these technologies for that purpose. This study considers the ethical aspects of AI systems for policing the dark web, including the trade-off between security and privacy, risks of bias and discrimination, and accountability in automated decision-making. Through a mixed-method approach involving both legal analysis, expert interviews, and case studies of existing AI-driven dark web monitoring systems, we identify central ethical challenges and potential mitigation strategies. In doing so, our results will reflect how AI may strengthen efficiency and effectiveness in terms of dark web policing, which equally result in the violation of user privacy, the perpetuation of systemic biases, and a lack of transparency in its operations. Ultimately, we conclude that proper use of AI in monitoring dark webs requires a robust governance framework, one that can ensure accountability, legitimacy, and respect for civil liberties. Such a framework must build on robust, clear guidelines for collecting and utilizing information, regular audits of bias, effectiveness, and mechanisms for human oversight and intervention. Given such measures, chances for using AI in the fight against crimes committed on the dark web are securely positioned within the right and constitutional means to protect the rights of individuals in this age of digitization.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-00350-8_12

Graph databases are proficient at revealing relationships and patterns in domains such as social networks, recommendation systems, the semantic web, and fraud detection. They facilitate intricate inquiries, including the determination of shortest paths, the identification of pivotal hubs, and the analysis of relationships. Although graph databases exhibit significant scalability and effectively handle extensive quantities of interconnected data, they frequently lack semantic Information, formal structure, and explicit typing. Knowledge graphs (KGs) mitigate these restrictions by structuring data in a graph format and linking data points via relationships to encapsulate Information. This chapter seeks to elucidate the functionalities of KGs, encompassing activities from traditional graph configurations to semantic frameworks, scalability issues, and query methodologies.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-93802-3_9

However, beyond self-attention, other deep neural architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer promising alternatives for capturing sequential patterns. In this paper, we explore the CNN-based architecture and propose L ocal-aware C onvolutional M odulation for Short-Term Sequential Rec ommendation (LCMRec). Like other convolutional neural network-based models, LCMRec benefits from strong local modelling capabilities through its convolutional architecture. By introducing the multi-head convolutional modulation (MHCM) unit, which applies convolutions with varying kernel sizes across multiple heads locally, LCMRec dynamically captures short-term dependencies at multiple scales and keeps a linear computational complexity. In experiments, LCMRec outperforms baseline models, demonstrating the efficacy of the convolutional architecture and validating the effectiveness of our approach in balancing multi-scale dependency modelling with computational efficiency.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02215-8_29
10.1007/978-3-032-01723-9_10,Geospatially-Informed Recommendations for Automobile Purchases: Integrating Spatial Analysis for Enhanced Decision-Making,"This research proposes an integrated recommendation framework to support automobile purchase decisions by aligning consumer preferences with spatial and technical factors. In response to the challenges faced by car buyers, particularly those with limited automotive expertise and overwhelmed by excessive information, the model leverages sentiment analysis from social media and combines it with spatial variables, including dealership density, vehicle availability, circulation restrictions, environmental suitability, and pricing. These factors are then matched with technical specifications to generate personalized and context-aware vehicle suggestions. Using Mexico City as a case study, the empirical analysis reveals that regional differences in infrastructure, regulatory policies, economic conditions, and environmental constraints strongly shape vehicle preferences. The findings show that consumers in areas with stricter vehicle regulations and better service infrastructure tend to prefer vehicles with higher initial costs but lower long-term maintenance demands. While the system is built around the socio-economic and infrastructural peculiarities of Mexico City, it has been designed with modular and configurable components, allowing it to be adapted to international contexts with similar data availability. Nevertheless, the dependence on locally specific variables should be explicitly acknowledged when considering its broader applicability. This raises the question of scalability and transferability, inviting further research into how the framework can be generalized across diverse urban and regulatory environments.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-01723-9_10

Recent research has increasingly shifted from traditional sequential models to Graph Neural Networks to more effectively encode complex dynamic collaborative information. Despite these advances, many approaches often overlook important higher-order relations at the motif level and the spatial dynamics within graphs. In this work, we propose a novel time-aware recommendation method named MoDynRec ( Mo tif-Enhanced Dyn amic Graph Learning for Rec ommendations), which effectively models higher-order features and their spatiotemporal evolution by incorporating motifs into dynamic graph representation learning. The approach employs a two-fold strategy: (1) a motif-preserving structural encoder, which aggregates higher-order information from diverse motifs to retain critical structural patterns, and (2) an attention-based temporal encoder, which integrates multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture sequential evolution patterns in the temporal dimension. This is further enhanced by dynamic graph convolution networks, which explore spatial correlations among nodes, improving adaptability to evolving relationships over time. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-93257-1_1
